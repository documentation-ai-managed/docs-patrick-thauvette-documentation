title: Key Concepts in St. Lawrence Maritime Transportation
description: Exploration of core ideas supporting the growth of maritime transport, including geographic and operational fundamentals.
---

## Overview

You operate within the dynamic St. Lawrence maritime ecosystem, managed by Les Armateurs du Saint-Laurent (ASL). This association unites 14 shipowners transporting goods and passengers across the St. Lawrence River, Great Lakes, Arctic waters, and Maritime provinces. Core concepts drive sustainable growth, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency. Understand these fundamentals to navigate challenges like ice conditions, environmental regulations, and trade routes effectively.

## St. Lawrence River Ecosystem

The St. Lawrence River forms the backbone of Canadian maritime transport, spanning over `{2,000 km}` from the Atlantic to the Great Lakes. You encounter diverse ecosystems including tidal zones, freshwater ports, and lock systems like those at the Welland Canal.

## Great Lakes and Arctic Routes

Extend your operations to interconnected Great Lakes and challenging Arctic passages. Great Lakes routes handle bulk cargo like grain and iron ore, while Arctic voyages demand ice-class vessels for summer navigation.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Great Lakes" icon="globe">
    You traverse Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior. Key considerations include `{<10m}` draft limits and winter closures from December to March.

## Data-Driven Route Analysis

Analyze routes programmatically to enhance decisions. The following examples process shipping data for St. Lawrence operations.

<CodeGroup tabs="Python,JavaScript">
  ```python
  import pandas as pd

  # Sample St. Lawrence route data
  routes = pd.DataFrame({
      'route': ['St. Lawrence', 'Great Lakes', 'Arctic'],
      'distance_km': [2000, 1600, 1400],
      'ice_risk': [0.1, 0.3, 0.8]
  })

  # Calculate risk-adjusted travel time
  routes['travel_days'] = routes['distance_km'] / 300 * (1 + routes['ice_risk'])
  print(routes)
  ```
  ```javascript
  // Sample St. Lawrence route data
  const routes = [
    { route: 'St. Lawrence', distanceKm: 2000, iceRisk: 0.1 },
    { route: 'Great Lakes', distanceKm: 1600, iceRisk: 0.3 },
    { route: 'Arctic', distanceKm: 1400, iceRisk: 0.8 }
  ];

  // Calculate risk-adjusted travel time
  routes.forEach(r => {
    r.travelDays = (r.distanceKm / 300) * (1 + r.iceRisk);
  });
  console.table(routes);
  ```
